  Welcome to Gooseberry Moon, where timeless elegance meets simplicity.
  Established at the end of 2008 by Print Designer, Nicola Jones, and is run from
  her home studio in North Wales.



  I have a passion for paper and design and believe stationery has a big part to
  play in any well styled event. Think monogrammed menus tucked in to each
  napkin, and personalised favour tags adorning gorgous gifts for your guests.
  It's this attention to detail that will help tie the overall look and feel
  together. Not forgetting the most important first glimpse when your guests open
  the invitation that has been customised especially for you.



  My delicate hand-drawn botanical illustrations, classic typography, simple
  patterns on beautiful papers make the perfect combination for an elegant and
  timeless celebration. You will also find my botanical illustrations on
  notebooks and art prints.



  I pride myself on excellent communication and customer service throughout the
  order process, ensuring it's an enjoyable and stress-free experience. If you
  have any questions please get in touch. As seen in March 2016 issue of Ideal
  Home Magazine!
